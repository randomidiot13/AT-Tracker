# AT-Tracker
AT-Tracker is a simple tkinter GUI that reads from the statistics file of your most recent Minecraft world and displays your progress towards the "Adventuring Time" achievement. Only useful for Java Edition versions 1.7 through 1.11, those being the only versions where this achievement exists.

Requirements:
- Windows (I'm fairly sure it won't work on other operating systems, but I may be wrong)
- Python 3.7+
